# Noggin.NetCore Auth
A simple library for doing social authentication in .NET Core MVC. It authenticates that people are who they say they are, but does not authorise them and has no opinion on how you store details about your users.

Instructions can be found at the [.NETCore Auth project site](http://coreauth.nogginbox.co.uk).

The source code in this repo also contains SampleSite which is a working example of using Noggin.NetCore Auth.
