# Noggin.NetCore Auth
A simple library for doing social logins in .NET Core MVC. Does the logging in part, but has no opinion on how you store details about your users.

Instructions can be found at the [.NETCore Auth project site](http://coreauth.nogginbox.co.uk).

The source code in this repo also contains SampleSite which is a working example of using Noggin.NetCore Auth.
